I've been working on getting a company/business license in Kuwait, thought I'd document it here just in case someone else would need it.

Opening a business in Kuwait has a bunch of requirements, this post reflects my own experience in getting a license, almost everything is handled through [Kuwait Business Center](kbc.moci.gov.kw) which makes it a bit simpler.
Also at some point you will need to rent a physical office (more to that later) but not early, so don't do that when you are starting [unless you really need the physical space, that's something else].

Note: This article **DOESN'T** cover the steps for the micro businesses [Home businesses].

> If at any point you had any questions to KBC, I'd suggest sending them a direct message on their [support account on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kbc_support). They usually reply in a couple of hours.

## Prerequisites:
- If you are not registered anywhere [officially unemployed], you will need to also register at [PIFSS](https://www.pifss.gov.kw/) under the **5th section** (باب خامس), you'd need to go there in person [here's a map url](https://g.page/PIFSS) and bring  with you.
    - Your original Civil ID.
    - Copy of birth certificate.
    - Copy of last academic degree [University certificate for example].
> There are multiple branches, not sure if you can do it in anywhere else, I went to the main one that I linked above.

- If you have any _fines/violations_ or _court orders_, you need to pay them before proceeding (or you can do it after you do the first step, but your application will be on hold), you can check if you have any with the MOI app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MoIKuwait) or for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moi-kuwait/id871764188).
> To pay a court order you can go to any Citizen's Service center (مركز خدمة المواطن) and do that. You can use [this website](https://www.moi.gov.kw/main/eservices/servicecentres/locations) to locate the nearest one for you.

## Steps:
If you have the prerequisites figured out, here are the REAL steps.
1. Head over to the [KBC license services portal](https://mociweb01.csc.gov.kw/MociKBC/WebPages/index.aspx) and click on `طلب تأسيس شركة أشخاص` and fill out the form. You will need to:
    - Declare the type of Activity (نشاط الشركة) your company will do from the list.  
    > you can select multiple activities but they have to all be under the same main section(قطاع). but be aware that later on you will pay a fee for each activity and it might include more paperwork, if you are in a hurry pick only the most important one then add the rest later, you can check which activities needs approvals by going to the `الإستعلام عن الأنشطة` section.
    - Provide **5 names** [In Arabic] which **SHOULD** include the name of the company activity (نشاط الشركة) in them [example: لومي لابز للحلول المتكاملة الحاسوبية] in the order of preference.
    - Declare company capital (رأس مال الشركة), minimum is **KD1000** for most activities but some are more, it'll show you an error if you picked an invalid amount.
> They seem to turn off the system every weekend (Thursday evening till Sunday morning) saying it's under maintenance 🤷🏽‍♂️ so you need to do everything on week days.

2. If all went fine in the previous step, you should get a reference number for the company establishment request number (رقم طلب عقد التأسيس) which you need to check the status of your application by going to the [same website](https://mociweb01.csc.gov.kw/MociKBC/WebPages/index.aspx) and clicking on `الإستعلام عن طلب التأسيس`.

3. Keep on checking every few days, in my case my status changed to `مراجعة وزارة الداخلية` which I had to go to this [Fingerprints Mishrif](https://goo.gl/maps/fqdJTY6TsbQn2pvi9) building [Depends on where you live] and meet with someone representing MOCI over there to approve my request [if you have any fines it'll stop the process here].

4. Wait and keep on checking on the status of your application from the website, mine took around 4 weeks and like 4 visits, but it shouldn't take more than a week to get approved.

5. After it's approved, you'd need to head over to the [KBC building in Ishbiliya](https://goo.gl/maps/Xug3DoPbBb4eEqdLA) with your company establishment request number (رقم طلب عقد التأسيس) and your KNet 💳 and talk to the **Ministry of Justice** representative.
    - You'll pay **KD10** via KNet for stamps.
    - You'll have to sign the Company Establishment Contract (عقد التأسيس) (3 copies).
    - Officially it says you need to also pay **7KD** as fees, but I didn't pay that (or at least I don't remember paying that).
    - You'll get a copy of the signed contract and they will take one (Actually they took 2, but one of them didn't have stamps on it).
    > You should be able to retrieve your Company register (السجل التجاري) from [the website](https://mociweb01.csc.gov.kw/MociKBC/WebPages/index.aspx) by clicking on `الخدمة الآلية لإصدار السجل التجاري` but you won't need it till after you get the office.
    
6. Now you have a period of **3 months** where you can start looking for an office which you need to get on it !.
> When looking for an office, make sure that it does have a **PACI Number (رقم آلي)**, there are some places without that so ask before you rent !

7. Paid your hard earned money for the office ? great ! get the rental contract and the receipts ready [scan them] and head over to [the same website that is now your friend](https://mociweb01.csc.gov.kw/MociKBC/WebPages/index.aspx) and go to `طلب ترخيص شركة` and fill out the form.
> For this step you'll need the 
- Company Register (السجل التجاري) [Can get from the same website].
- PACI Number (رقم آلي) [Should be written in the contract].
- Office Rental Receipt.

8. Wait a couple of days [or maybe Immediately, not sure] and go to the `طباعة كتب الجهات الرقابية` section, there might be some more paperwork to be done depending on which activities you picked, if there are any documents to be processed there then print them [I was told they need to be printed in Colors] and head over to KBC again to get them signed then you have to take each document to where it needs to go [Mine for example was one for the Ministry of Media and another for CITRA, take a copy of everything you have with you just in case including the **Company Register** and your **College Certificate**].
