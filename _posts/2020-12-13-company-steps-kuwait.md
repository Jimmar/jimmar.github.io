I've been working on getting a company/business license in Kuwait, thought I'd document it here just in case someone else would need it.

Opening a business in Kuwait has a bunch of requirements, this post reflects my own experience in getting a license, almost everything is handled through [Kuwait Business Center](kbc.moci.gov.kw) which makes it a bit simpler.
Also at some point you will need to rent a physical office (more to that later) but not early, so don't do that when you are starting [unless you really need the physical space, that's something else].

Note: This article **DOESN'T** cover the steps for the micro businesses [Home businesses].

> If at any point you had any questions to KBC, I'd suggest sending them a direct message on their [support account on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kbc_support). They usually reply in a couple of hours.

## Prerequisites:
- If you are not registered anywhere [officially unemployed], you will need to also register at [PIFSS](https://www.pifss.gov.kw/) under the **5th section** (باب خامس), you'd need to go there in person [here's a map url](https://g.page/PIFSS) and bring  with you.
    - Your original Civil ID.
    - Copy of birth certificate.
    - Copy of last academic degree [University certificate for example].
> There are multiple branches, not sure if you can do it in anywhere else, I went to the main one that I linked above.

- If you have any _fines/violations_ or _court orders_, you need to pay them before proceeding (or you can do it after you do the first step, but your application will be on hold), you can check if you have any with the MOI app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.MoIKuwait) or for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moi-kuwait/id871764188).
> To pay a court order you can go to any Citizen's Service center (مركز خدمة المواطن) and do that. You can use [this website](https://www.moi.gov.kw/main/eservices/servicecentres/locations) to locate the nearest one for you.

## Steps:
If you have the prerequisites figured out, here are the REAL steps.
1. Head over to the [KBC license services portal](https://mociweb01.csc.gov.kw/MociKBC/WebPages/index.aspx) and click on `طلب تأسيس شركة أشخاص` and fill out the form. You will need to:
    - Declare the type of Activity (نشاط الشركة) your company will do from the list.  
    > you can select multiple activities but they have to all be under the same main section(قطاع). but be aware that later on you will pay a fee for each activity and it might include more paperwork, if you are in a hurry pick only the most important one then add the rest later, you can check which activities needs approvals by going to the `الإستعلام عن الأنشطة` section.
    - Provide **5 names** [In Arabic] which **SHOULD** include the name of the company activity (نشاط الشركة) in them [example: لومي لابز للحلول المتكاملة الحاسوبية] in the order of preference.
    - Declare company capital (رأس مال الشركة), minimum is **KD1000** for most activities but some are more, it'll show you an error if you picked an invalid amount.
> They seem to turn off the system every weekend (Thursday evening till Sunday morning) saying it's under maintenance 🤷🏽‍♂️ so you need to do everything on week days.

2. If all went fine in the previous step, you should get a reference number for the company establishment request number (رقم طلب عقد التأسيس) which you need to check the status of your application by going to the [same website](https://mociweb01.csc.gov.kw/MociKBC/WebPages/index.aspx) and clicking on `الإستعلام عن طلب التأسيس`.

3. Keep on checking every few days, in my case my status changed to `مراجعة وزارة الداخلية` which I had to go to this [Fingerprints Mishrif](https://goo.gl/maps/fqdJTY6TsbQn2pvi9) building [Depends on where you live] and meet with someone representing MOCI over there to approve my request [if you have any fines it'll stop the process here].

4. Wait and keep on checking on the status of your application from the website, mine took around 4 weeks and like 4 visits, but it shouldn't take more than a week to get approved.

5. After it's approved, you'd need to head over to the [KBC building in Ishbiliya](https://goo.gl/maps/Xug3DoPbBb4eEqdLA) with your company establishment request number (رقم طلب عقد التأسيس) and your KNet 💳 and talk to the **Ministry of Justice** representative.
    - You'll pay **KD10** via KNet for stamps.
    - You'll have to sign the Company Establishment Contract (عقد التأسيس) (3 copies).
    - Officially it says you need to also pay **KD7** as fees, but I didn't pay that (or at least I don't remember paying that).
    - You'll get a copy of the signed contract and they will take one (Actually they took 2, but one of them didn't have stamps on it).
    > You should be able to retrieve your Company register (السجل التجاري) from [the website](https://mociweb01.csc.gov.kw/MociKBC/WebPages/index.aspx) by clicking on `الخدمة الآلية لإصدار السجل التجاري` but you won't need it till after you get the office.
    
6. Now you have a period of **3 months** where you can start looking for an office which you need to get on it !.
> When looking for an office, make sure that it does have a **PACI Number (رقم آلي)**, there are some places without that so ask before you rent !

7. Paid your hard earned money for the office ? great ! get the rental contract and the receipts ready [scan them] and head over to [the same website that is now your friend](https://mociweb01.csc.gov.kw/MociKBC/WebPages/index.aspx) and go to `طلب ترخيص شركة` and fill out the form.
> For this step you'll need the 
- Company Register (السجل التجاري) [Can get from the same website].
- PACI Number (رقم آلي) [Should be written in the contract].
- Office Rental Receipt.

8. Wait a couple of days [or maybe Immediately, not sure] and go to the `طباعة كتب الجهات الرقابية` section, there might be some more paperwork to be done depending on which activities you picked, if there are any documents to be processed there then print them [I was told they need to be printed in Colors] and head over to KBC again to get them signed then you have to take each document to where it needs to go [Mine for example was one for the Ministry of Media and another for CITRA, take a copy of everything you have with you just in case including the **Company Register** and your **College Certificate**]. 

9. Now you need to finish the process with each place, as soon as you get the approval from them head over to the KBC website and click on `إصدار ترخيص و دفع الرسوم` section, you'd need to pay **KD87** 😩 and you should be able to print it from them.
> I suggest that you print this and hang it on your office as soon as are done, I waited one day and I got a rejection message from [PACI](https://www.paci.gov.kw) due to missing license on the door, if that happened you'd need to visit them.

10. Technically you finished getting the license, but there are other things needed
- Sign up for Chamber of commerce (costs **KD82**) not sure if it's required but I did.
- Visit [PACI](https://www.paci.gov.kw) [In person] and register your company there properly, do that just in case there was a miscommunication between them and MOCI.

Congratulations, now you have your company officially registered in Kuwait, if you want to hire or register yourself under the company then continue reading on the Bonus chapter, if not then you should be done !

## Bonus
If you want to be able to hire employees and/or register yourself under the company (to also get the allowance دعم العمالة) then this part is for you.

> This part can get messy, things kept on changing while I was doing it so comment if your experience was different than mine.

1. Head over to the e-forms section of the website of the [Public Authority of Manpower](https://e-forms.manpower.gov.kw/E-Forms/faces/Welcome) and click on `بوابة النماذج الإلكترونية` then on `طلب فتح ملف جديد لصاحب عمل`.
> The website is very annoying, it refused to accept my clicks, I kept on changing the font size on website till it worked, try it with different browsers if it didn't work for you.

2. Fill the form and you should be getting a PDF to sign, sign it and then go to `إقرار صحة بيانات الطلب` and upload it over there with any required documents. You'd need to have a printed version with you because you are gonna go to them physically [Note that you need to visit them in less than a week from doing this, if you waited longer then you'd have to do it again...].

3. Where you go depends on your area, mine was in Hawalli so I had to go to that branch of Public Authority of Manpower, specifically to the computer department [الحاسب الالي] where you'll finish up the registration and digitally sign.

4. After you are done you'll need to pay KD25 somewhere over there (not sure what that place was called) and then you'd be done with this and should be able to print the proof of signature (اعتماد توقيع) which you'll need later on.

5. Now you need to register yourself under the company [On this site](https://www.manpower.gov.kw/Comp_RegisterNew.aspx). I only registered myself as fifth section (باب خامس) so dunno what's the process for the rest, the 3d section (باب ثالث) is for local hires, not sure what's the case for expats.

6. You'll also need to register for this new ["Ashal" service](https://e-portal.manpower.gov.kw/PamAshalPortalApp/) which you'd use to register the employees.
> I had an issue while trying to register myself that the only jobs available were driver, tea-boy, and janitor. I went to so many places trying to fix it but somehow it fixed itself after a week.

7. You'd need to register yourself here by filling all the documents under `طلب إشعار تسجيل عمالة وطنية` and then waiting for them to approve/disapprove it.
